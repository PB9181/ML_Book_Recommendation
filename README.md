# ML_Book_Recommendation
# Book recommendation project- My first one
Description
Book Rent is the largest online and offline book rental chain in India. They provide books of various genres, such as thrillers, mysteries, romances, and science fiction. The company charges a fixed rental fee for a book per month. Lately, the company has been losing its user base. The main reason for this is that users are not able to choose the right books for themselves. The company wants to solve this problem and increase its revenue and profit.

# Project Objective:
The main objective is to create a book recommendation project

# Technology used
Python, Pandas, Numpy, stats and ML algorithm

# Following operations should be performed:
* Read the books dataset and explore it
* Clean up NaN values
* Read the data where ratings are given by users
* Take a quick look at the number of unique users and books
* Convert ISBN variables to numeric numbers in the correct order
* Convert the user_id variable to numeric numbers in the correct order
* Convert both user_id and ISBN to the ordered list, i.e., from 0...n-1
* Re-index the columns to build a matrix
